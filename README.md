# Soft Skills SIG
## Mission
The SIG goal is to contribute to the development of soft skills amongst e-Science employees, especially those relevant for project success (effective communication, feedback techniques, time organization, etc). Our objective is to leverage internal knowledge and skills through workshop sessions (discussion and topical) for peers to exchange challenges, coping strategies and positive outcomes. The workshop sessions will have a predetermined agenda, which anybody can propose to the SIG leads. The structures are:

* Discussion session: Discuss experiences with issues regarding soft skills (or the lack thereof) in a concrete project with peers. This type of session exists to express feelings and learn from each other's experiences.
* Topical session: The presenter talks about a soft skills topic, providing the SIG with information about a certain soft skill, e.g. a framework that can be used to improve communication or the understanding of communication. How can I communicate in a more effective way with her?

## Soft Skills Definition
Soft skills, also known as power skills, common skills, essential skills, or core skills, are psychosocial skills generally applicable to all professions. These include critical thinking, problem solving, public speaking, professional writing, teamwork, digital literacy, leadership, professional attitude, work ethic, career management and intercultural fluency. This is in contrast to hard skills, which are specific to individual professions. [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_skills)
